Sharp, crisp corners. Smooth, delicate curves. A healthy sprinkling of dots and waves, lovingly drawn and contained within a frame that was easy for anyone to fall in love with. She didn’t need to be the greatest work of art. Nothing about her seemed to want to go that far. She was a work of passion, a little spark, a ray of sunshine.<br><br>Her artist stepped back, smiling at her. Her latest work was just about complete and ready to show the world. Though any third party would have guessed her age to be somewhere in-between an adolescent and an adult, her composure in no way reflected this. She was lean, but not particularly thin. Petite, but not particularly small. Her long, ghost-white, feather-soft hair was held in two buns, with the remainder tucked just behind her ear and resting gently on her shoulders. Her electrically green eyes were offset by a little checker mark on her face.<br><br>Dressing her up had been the artist’s favorite part. Ornate was her creation’s name, and it was appropriate. She was given an off-white, slightly checkered skirt, long, white boots, and a jacket with so many meticulously crafted details in greyscale that it nearly seemed gluttonous. Yet here she was.<br><br>The artist placed her hand on her new creation’s forehead. Now that the paint had dried and the spell was cast, it was time for her to come to life.<br><br>It was as if a vacuum had appeared just behind her eyes. As what was previously inanimate began to expand and contract in response to light, the life in the room ceased to exist. The artist couldn’t help but hold her breath.<br><br>And to the girl herself, it was as if waking up from a dream. She was nearly taken away by the lights, the colors, the sounds, the smells, and the innumerable about of feelings she had been suddenly gifted. The room was simple, but the color felt to her as if her eyes were serenading her. Some music had been playing in the background, and it was the first thing her ears heard. It was just a low-quality set of drums with unidentifiable melodies atop it, but at the time, nothing seemed more magical.<br><br>The artist smiled with teeth. “Good morning.”<br><br>The girl looked up with those green eyes, blinking.&nbsp; Oddly enough, whenever she came back to this memory, it felt as if the creator were speaking gibberish. However, at the time, she understood her words. “Good morning?” she replied, trying to copy her creator.<br><br>She sighed, placing a hand on her cheek. “I’m happy to see you.<br><br>The girl finally got a chance to look around more freely and down at herself. She marveled at the handiwork of herself in the same way someone might admire a quaint cottage. She fell in love with every detail, every deviation, every frill, every texture. And despite being brand-new, she knew that this gift was crafted with her in mind. She fit into it to the minutest possible degree. This<br>was her new home, and no one could take it away from her.<br><br>She lifted a hand to her creator’s wrist, holding on. She spoke in the language she was provided to speak. “Thank you for creating me.”<br><br>Sighing, the artist sat back in her seat. She reached over to a nearby table, snatching up a clipboard and a pencil. The magic was starting to fade from the moment, though it was still ever-present. “Memory test,” she yawned, scratching her eye with her free hand. “What’s the Tomo-Tetsudai motto?”<br><br>The girl, still entranced by her own existence, was barely away from being too distracted to hear the question. She coughed, standing up erect. “The motto. Tomodachi Tetsudai strives to design and deliver only the best quality Tetsudai for any need.” The girl blinked. She did not remember ever having been told the motto, but it seemed natural, as if it were as easy as blinking, something she had not noticed she was doing yet.<br><br>The artist checked a box. “Sing me a song. Your choice.”<br><br>She blinked. “Is that on your checklist?”<br><br>Putting the checklist down onto her lap and out of her line of sight, the artist shook her head. “I just want to hear you, k?” At that, she snapped her finger, and the music that had previously been filling the room began to die down.<br><br>The girl closed her eyes. She was brand new to the world, but that wasn’t going to stop her from searching through the crevices of what memories she had been given for a song. And then, she found one. It would only be a verse, but a verse should be enough, she thought.<br><br>She swayed back and forth, feet pointed inward.<br><br><br>“And I sway, and I sway<br><br>It was just a dream anyway<br><br>Though I drown in a bottomless sea<br><br>The midnight moon shines above me<br><br>And I sway, and I sway, and I sway<br><br>Thoughts that just won't go away…”<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>“Alright,” said her creator, “I don’t need to go through this checklist. We’re all good. Are you ready to go on an adventure?’<br><br>The girl blinked. “Adventure?”<br><br>Her creator walked over to a window and tapped on the glass. “Come here.”<br><br>She obediently followed, peeking out the window. Blue boxes, lit up like Christmas lights, dotted the horizon. The sky was a milky, creamy shade of black, speckled with pinpricks of white. Colors ribbons of smoke slithered across the expanse above, solid enough to feel but vapor enough to float. Below, she found entities equally as intriguing. Pink-flowered Sakura trees in a line dotted the sidewalks, decorated with glowing orbs of light. Pools of water stood interfaces with the sidewalk, their dark, mirror-like surface allowing anyone to peer into what seemed to be another world. And there were people just like her and her creator, walking through the city on either side, attending their business, enjoying themselves and the scenery, or sleeping standing up. Everything about it made the girl feel as if she wanted to cry but couldn’t; as if she were floating and yet wrapped up in a blanket. It was surreal, and yet right here, close enough to touch.<br><br>“That’s where you’ll be,” she replied. “Sakura.”<br><br>Sighing, the girl found herself obsessed with this world. She could barely contain herself, as a high-pitched buzz began to emit from the back of her throat. This was gonna be her new home.<br><br>Her creator smiled. “You’re going to have a new supervisor, who’s going to take care of you, and you’re going to help. Because that’s what the Tetsudai do. You help others. Here’s my card,” she said, putting a small, three-by-five-inch card in her hand. “You hold onto this, and if anything goes wrong, you let me know, alright?”<br><br>The girl nodded. “Yes.”<br><br>She smiled, taking her by the hand. She led the girl across the studio and towards a large, metallic panel. The surface rippled as if it were made of Mercury. “This is where I leave you. Take care.”<br><br>Her eyes widened. “I’m not going to see you again?”<br><br>She shrugged. “Maybe. This is what’s best. Go through the veil.”<br><br>The girl turned around, facing the metal. In it, she could see her reflection. Her arms were shaking a little, and her face was drooping down like the branches of the trees below. She slowly inched towards the veil, but her velocity was steadily decreasing until finally she stopped. A tear rolled down her face. A sharp pinprick of cold began in her upper back and ran downward.<br><br>“When you feel like this,” said the artist, “Sing the song you sang for me. That will always be special.”<br><br>Smiling, she gave her creator one last embrace. It was reciprocated, though not for long.<br><br>“Go make someone happy,” she sighed, gently nudging the girl through the glassy portal.<br><br>Its surface was smooth and cold. The more of herself came into contact with it, the less she could feel. It felt as if she were unwinding once more into the cold void of oblivion. After no longer being able to see, she began to panic, desiring to scream but no longer sensing the faculties to. However, she calmed herself down. Her creator promised that she would be able to walk on the trees below, to enjoy her new home, to make someone happy. It wasn’t possible this was the end.<br><br>And so she dissolved.<br><br><br><br>
